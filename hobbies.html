        <p>
            In my free time, I love to compete in Sim Racing. I find it thrilling. Sim Racing allows me to experience the excitement of racing from the comfort of my own home. I enjoy the competitive aspect and the opportunity to improve my skills on virtual tracks.

            Another hobby of mine is photography. Capturing moments through the lens of a camera is something I find fulfilling. Whether it's landscapes, portraits, or SP shots, photography allows me to express myself and preserve memories.

            Additionally, I have a passion for cooking. Experimenting with different recipes and flavors in the kitchen is something I find enjoyable. Cooking allows me to be creative and share delicious meals with friends and family.

            Lastly, I love sports, but mostly baseball. Currently playing in a recreational league. I play in the same team with my dad and I love sharing the field with him. Baseball is a great way for me to stay active and bond with my family.
