            <p>
                Since 2020, what started as a joke between family and friends, its now a part-time job
                I picked up a camera without knowing I would grow fast and big. Sponsoring soccer teams, working with LigaMX (professional soccer league in Mexico)
                Having weddings, marathons, involved in the biggest baseball league at home (Juarez)

            <p>
              Since last year (2025) my parents and I started bulding a party hall, where my great grandparents lived once, and finally, at the beginning of the year,
              we got to officially open to business! Terraza Doce 24 its ready for the best events in Juarez.... maybe El Paso/Las Cruces next?
